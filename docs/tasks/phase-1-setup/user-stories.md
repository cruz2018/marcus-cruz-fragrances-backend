# Phase 1 — Setup (User Stories)

- As a developer, I want a clean NestJS project scaffold so I can build features quickly.
- As a developer, I want core dependencies installed so the app compiles and runs.
- As a developer, I want environment configuration so secrets are not hardcoded.
- As a team, we want linting/formatting so code style is consistent.
- As a team, we want git initialized so changes are tracked and shareable.
