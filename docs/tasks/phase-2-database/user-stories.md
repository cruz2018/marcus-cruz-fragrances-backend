# Phase 2 — Database (User Stories)

- As a developer, I want a Prisma schema so the database reflects the domain.
- As a developer, I want migrations so schema changes are reproducible.
- As a developer, I want seed data so I can test quickly.
- As a developer, I want to verify DB connectivity so the app can read/write data.
